Jitialize: A just-in-time compiler for C++
==========================================

About
-----

Jitialize is a _compiler-assisted_ library that enables simple Just-In-Time
code generation for C++ codes.

Building
--------

First, install clang and LLVM.

```bash
apt install llvm-6.0-dev llvm-6.0-tools clang-6.0
```

Then, configure and compile the project.

```bash
cmake -DLLVM_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-6.0/cmake <path_to_jitialize_src>
cmake --build .
```

To build the examples, install the [opencv](https://opencv.org/) library, 
and add the flags ```-DEASY_JIT_EXAMPLE=1``` to the cmake command.

To enable benchmarking, install the [google benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) framework, 
and add the flags ```-DEASY_JIT_BENCHMARK=1 -DBENCHMARK_DIR=<path_to_google_benchmark_install>``` to the cmake command.

Everything is ready to go!

### Docker

If you want to give only a quick test to the project, everything is provided to use it with docker.
To do this, generate a Dockerfile from the current directory using the scripts in ```<path_to_jitialize_src>/misc/docker```, 
then generate your docker instance.

```bash
python3 <path_to_jitialize_src>/misc/docker/GenDockerfile.py  <path_to_jitialize_src>/.travis.yml > Dockerfile
docker build -t jitialize/test -f Dockerfile
docker run -ti jitialize/test /bin/bash
```

Basic usage
-----------

### Compiling my project with Jitialize

Since the Jitialize library relies on assistance from the compiler, its
mandatory to load a compiler plugin in order to use it.
The flag ```-Xclang -load -Xclang <path_to_jitialize_build>/bin/JitializePass.so```
loads the plugin.

The included headers require C++14 support, and remember to add the include directories!
Use ```--std=c++14 -I<path_to_jitialize_src>/cpplib/include```.

Finaly, the binary must be linked against the Jitialize runtime library, using
```-L<path_to_jitialize_build>/bin -lJitializeRuntime```.

Putting all together we get the command bellow.

```bash
clang++-6.0 --std=c++14 <my_file.cpp> \
  -Xclang -load -Xclang /path/to/jitialize/jit/build/bin/bin/JitializePass.so \
  -I<path_to_jitialize_src>/cpplib/include \
  -L<path_to_jitialize_build>/bin -lJitializeRuntime
```

### Using Jitialize inside my project

Consider the code below from a software that applies image filters on a video stream.
In the following sections we are going to adapt it to use the Jitialize library.
The function to optimize is ```kernel```, which applies a mask on the entire image.

The mask, its dimensions and area do not change often, so specializing the function for
these parameters seems reasonable.
Moreover, the image dimensions and number of channels typically remain constant during
the entire execution; however, it is impossible to know their values as they depend on the stream.

```cpp
</include camfilter.cpp ORIGINAL/>
```

The main header for the library is ```jitialize/jit.h```, where the only core function
of the library is exported. This function is called -- guess how? -- ```jitialize::jit```.
We add the corresponding include directive them in the top of the file.

```cpp
</include camfilter.cpp INCLUDE_EASY/>
```

With the call to ```jitialize::jit```, we specialize the function and obtain a new
one taking only two parameters (the input and the output frame).

```cpp
</include camfilter.cpp EASY/>
```

#### Deducing which functions to expose at runtime

Jitialize embeds the [LLVM bitcode](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html)
representation of the functions to specialize at runtime in the binary code.
To perform this, the library requires access to the implementation of these
functions.
Jitialize does an effort to deduce which functions are specialized at runtime,
still in many cases this is not possible.

In this case, it's possible to use the ```EASY_JIT_EXPOSE``` macro, as shown in
the following code,

```cpp
void EASY_JIT_EXPOSE kernel() { /* ... */ }
```

or using a regular expression during compilation.
The command bellow exports all functions whose name starts with "^kernel".

```bash
clang++ ... -mllvm -jitialize-export="^kernel.*"  ...
```

#### Caching

In parallel to the ```jitialize/jit.h``` header, there is ```jitialize/code_cache.h``` which
provides a code cache to avoid recompilation of functions that already have been
generated.

Bellow we show the code from previous section, but adapted to use a code cache.

```cpp
</include camfilter.cpp INCLUDE_EASY_CACHE/>
```

```cpp
</include camfilter.cpp EASY_CACHE/>
```
